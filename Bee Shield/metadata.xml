    <description>I like The Binding of Isaac and Borderlands 2 very much.
So I asked myself, why not both ?

I will be trying to implement items to TBoI from Borderlands 2 such as the Bee Shield.

Since shield mechanics in Borderlands 2 do not exist in The Binding of Isaac obviously, I implemented it in a simplier way.

It's a passive item. After picking up, this item will increase your damage following this formula: damage = (damage / 2) + (floornumber / 5). The gimmick is, you will only get this damage bonus when you don't have any empty or half-empty heart containers.

Thanks to Eufuu and Lytebringr from YouTube and all the beautiful people on The Modding of Isaac Discord page for helping me out.
