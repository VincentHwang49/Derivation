    <description>This mod makes it so that all the mushroom related collectibles item will resemble the item &quot;Magic Mushroom&quot;.

I just wanted them to look the same so I pretty much made this for myself but I thought sharing it isn't a very bad idea. If you feel like this is a cool edit, go ahead and subscribe to the mod.

Cheers!

Also if you remember this mod from moddingofisaac.com, don't worry, I am the original author and that's my second account there who posted this mod.</description>
